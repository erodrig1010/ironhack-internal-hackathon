What sets Miami apart?

A Growing Startup City
Miami is one of the fastest growing startup cities in America, 2nd only to Austin, TX. 
At our location in Building.co, a state-of-the-art co-working space in the heart of Miami, 
you'll be at the epicenter of this dynamic startup city.

An International Hub
With the largest foreign-born population of any US city, Miami has become an international hub for tech and business. 
Ironhack Miami's students & staff will expose you to many of the opportunities that make Miami so unique.

A Global Center for the Arts
Home to the largest art fair in America (Art Basel Miami Beach), Miami has become a booming cultural hub for both the US 
and the World. Best of all, we're only 10 minutes away from Miami’s artistic home, Wynwood.

Work hard, play hard
We all know that it can’t be just work. It doesn’t matter what you’re looking for -- whether it’s world-class nightclubs, 
chill craft beer bars or beach parties during the day, Miami has some of the world’s best entertainment alternatives a few 
minutes away from our campus.
